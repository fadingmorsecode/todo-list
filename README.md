# Project Summary:
A staple for many webdev tutorial, the todolist project is a very simple yet challenging project. Users can add, edit, delete, and prioritize tasks with key details such as titles, descriptions, due dates, and priorities. Projects themselves can be deleted and contain tasks. The default project is called Inbox and contains every task. All projects and todos can be stored via localStorage so that your data is persistent. 

# Goals:
* Use factories or constructors/classes to dynamically create todo objects.
* Define properties for todo items, including at least title, description, due date, and priority. Consider adding notes or a checklist.
* Separate application logic (creating todos, setting completion status, changing priority, etc.) from DOM-related operations. Use separate modules for these functionalities.
* Consider using the date-fns library for date and time formatting and manipulation. Use Web Storage API, specifically localStorage, for persistence. Save projects and todos to localStorage on creation, and retrieve data from localStorage when the app loads.
* Acknowledge the limitations of localStorage, such as data accessibility only on the computer where it was created, and the inability to store functions in JSON format.
  
# Reflection:
This project brought me so much frustration yet joy, and was one of the greatest learning experiences I have had during my time doing The Odin Project's curriculum. On every breakthough I cheered and was so ecstatic. I don't think there's a lot that compares to the feeling of finally figuring out a working solution to something while coding. On the journey to reaching this project, there were many times where I would see others complain of this project in the discord (regarding the difficulty). It seemed so daunting then, but oddly enough I didn't have as much hesitation tackling this project in comparison to when I was on Tic Tac Toe. I'm incredibly satisfied that I had minimal help while doing this project, and the only thing that took me for a serious ride was wrapping my head around `localStorage`. With that being said, it's never a bad thing to get help when stuck and is actually what you should be doing. To quote an extremely helpful person in TOP discord, `Inevitably, the hardest project is either the one directly in front of us, or the one directly behind us`.

A shoutout to the article that completely changed the way I thought and will think when creating projects. Build the support to the house and then make it look pretty!
